# MyTime-SE-Project

Product Scope: 

This software will act as a free-slot finder and will be made available to the customers after deployment. This product aims to find a free slot as to when a cancelled class can be rescheduled or a new class can be added. This application will display the common free slot of all the students. The database will contain all the students’ timetables.

Future Scope: 

• Utilizing this application to schedule club/societal events
• Making it possible for the faculty to send out the decided free slot as a mobile notification to all the concerned students

Product Perspective: 

This software is used to find free-slots in our schedule. It will list all the common free slots of all the students of a particular stream. This can be done manually, but becomes an extremely tedious process for the teacher to decide upon a slot for scheduling a cancelled or an extra class. To avoid this tedious task, the decision was made to build this application. Also, the user does not need to be well versed in technology to use this application

Product Functions: 

Two major functions have been identified that the software will incorporate. They are as follows:
• Input of the Timetable: This software will allow the user to input their weekly timetable.
• Finding a free-slot: This software will search for a free time-slot by overlapping the students’ timetables present in the database.
